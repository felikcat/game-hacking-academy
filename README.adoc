NOTE: Heavily a work in progress. The purpose of this guide is to provide a structured resource to make game hacking as easy as possible for $0.

=== Let's jump straight into it.

- If you pivoted into writing your own small programs from knowledge provided by that book, which is recommended, I would reference the book and this website: https://www.cbyexample.com/
. x64 Intel assembly knowledge is also vital. Do all of the challenges, and optionally write tiny programs in that assembly:
